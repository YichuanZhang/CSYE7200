This project creates a reverse-Polish calculator with a web interface.
======================================================================

The components that are used by this project are:
* Play
* Activator
* Akka
* and dependencies thereof

In order to run the calculator (essentially a web server), run:

  activator run
  
Now connect your web browser to localhost:9000

Passing the query "/" will simply give you the state of the calculator's stack.

Passing a string following the "/" will result in passing that string to the calculator.

So, for example, GET /1%202%20+ will result in a value of 3 (where %20 is the encoding for space).
